# CUSTOMER-SEGMENTATION-PROJECT

This project segments mall customers using the K-Means clustering algorithm based on demographic and behavioral data. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow Method and validated with the Silhouette Score. Visualizations, including pair plots and radar charts, illustrate the distinct customer segments. Targeted growth strategies are devised to enhance customer experience and drive mall performance. Special thanks to Dr. Vandit Hedau and Prof. V.B. Gupta for their guidance.
